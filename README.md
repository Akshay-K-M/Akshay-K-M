Heyylo,

I'm Akshay K M, a student International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B) studying Computer Science. I enjoy programming and solving problems. In my freetime I play badminton and watch a lot of movies and web series.

I’m currently learning about web development and competitive programming.
